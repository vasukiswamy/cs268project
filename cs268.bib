ABSTRACT="The Internet of Things (IoT) envisions simultaneous sensing and actuation
of numerous wirelessly connected devices. Emerging human-in-the-loop
applications demand low- latency high-reliability communication protocols,
paralleling the requirements for high-performance industrial control. This
paper introduces a wireless communication protocol based on network coding
that in conjunction with cooperative communication techniques builds the
necessary diversity to achieve the target reliability. The proposed
protocol, XOR-CoW, is analyzed by using a communication theoretic
delay-limited-capacity frame- work and compared to different realizations
of previously pro- posed protocols without network coding. The results show
that as the network size or payload increases, XOR-CoW gains advantage in
minimum SNR to achieve the target latency. For a scenario inspired by an
industrial printing application with 30 nodes in the control loop, total
information throughput of 4.8 Mb/s, 20MHz of bandwidth and cycle time under
2 ms, the protocol can robustly achieve a system probability of error
better than 10−9 with a nominal SNR less than 2 dB with Rayleigh fading."
